      <p>
        I used to work with large datasets as a test development engineer which
        helped me realize my love-hate relationship with data. I also used to do
        creative work as a hobby, playing around with presentations and
        infographics. I got fascinated with the idea of marrying data, design
        and development together which led me into this field

        in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland that specializes in data visualization and user
        experience design.
